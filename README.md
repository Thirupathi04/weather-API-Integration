# 🌤 Weather Dashboard

Hi there! I'm **Thirupathirao Ramagani**, a B.Tech student in Computer Science (AI & ML) at CBIT. This project is a part of my hands-on learning journey into frontend web development and API integration.

The **Weather Dashboard** is a responsive and interactive website that lets users check the current weather in any city using live data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — it's designed to be clean, fast, and beginner-friendly.
